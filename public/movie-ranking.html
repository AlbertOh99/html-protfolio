<h1>Albert's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My personal top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>One of my personal favorite anime movies of all time,
    mainly because it was one of my first
</p>

<h3>Suzume</h3>
<p>A recent movie that I watched, I really enjoyed the story
    and visuals. Almost everything was gorgious, I have a few problems
    with the GCI but other than that it was a very good movie.</p>

<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>What more do I have to say, it is one of the Pixar classics</p>
